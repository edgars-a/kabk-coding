# processing
In this course we are going to use a programming environment called [processing](http://processing.org/).

> Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. Initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within a visual context, Processing evolved into a development tool for professionals. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.

## getting started
- [download](https://processing.org/download/?processing)
- [the processing user interface](http://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/)
- [the environment](http://processing.org/reference/environment/)

## where to find help / answers?
You can always ask me, but I encourage you try to figure out your problem yourself first. Finding and fixing errors is a big part of programming; programmers actually need to look up stuff *all the time.*
- reading the [FAQ](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/FAQ)
- consulting the [reference](http://processing.org/reference/)
- check if there is s.th. in the [processing WIKI](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki)
- asking a question [in the forum](http://forum.processing.org/)
- [google](http://www.google.com)
- general programming questions: [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
