This repository will contain examples for the `coding` class at [kabk](http://www.kabk.nl), for part-time students of the graphic design department 2014-15.

The latest version is always [downloadable here](https://github.com/freder/kabk-coding/archive/master.zip).

# processing
In this course we are going to use a programming environment called [processing](http://processing.org/).

> Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. Initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within a visual context, Processing evolved into a development tool for professionals. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.

## code examples

- [hello mouse](001/code/s002_hello_mouse/s002_hello_mouse.pde)

## homework #1
1. Choose a cartoon character you like and draw it in processing. Use the shapes we've used in class, but also have a look at [the reference](http://processing.org/reference/) for things we may not have talked about â€” check out the items under the following sections: __2D Primitives__, __Curves__
2. To familiarize yourself with what's possible with *creative coding,* take some time to browse through [creative applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net/).

## where to find help / answers?
You can always ask me, but I encourage you try to figure out your problem yourself first. Finding and fixing errors is a big part of programming; programmers actually need to look up stuff *all the time.*
- reading the [FAQ](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/FAQ)
- consulting the [reference](http://processing.org/reference/)
- check if there is s.th. in the [processing WIKI](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki)
- asking a question [in the forum](http://forum.processing.org/)
- [google](http://www.google.com)
