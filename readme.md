This repository will contain examples for the `coding` class at [kabk](http://www.kabk.nl), for part-time students of the graphic design department 2014-15.

The latest version is always [downloadable here](https://github.com/freder/kabk-coding/archive/master.zip).

# processing
- [download](https://processing.org/download/?processing)
- [the processing user interface](http://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/)

## code examples
- [hello world](001/code/s001_hello_world/s001_hello_world.pde)
- [hello mouse](001/code/s002_hello_mouse/s002_hello_mouse.pde)

## homework #1
Choose a cartoon character you like and draw it in processing. Use the shapes we've used in class, but also have a look at [the reference](http://processing.org/reference/) for things we may not have talked about â€” check out the items under the following sections: __2D Prmimitives__, __Curves__

## where to find help / answers?
You can always ask me, but I encourage you try to figure out your problem yourself first. Finding and fixing errors is a big part of programming; programmers actually need to look up stuff *all the time.*
- reading the [FAQ](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/FAQ)
- consulting the [reference](http://processing.org/reference/)
- check if there is s.th. in the [processing WIKI](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki)
- asking a question [in the forum](http://forum.processing.org/)
- [google](http://www.google.com)
- general programming questions: [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
