## homework
1. Choose a cartoon character you like and draw it in processing. Use the shapes we've used in class, but also have a look at [the reference](http://processing.org/reference/) for things we may not have talked about â€” check out the items under the following sections: __2D Primitives__, __Curves__
2. To familiarize yourself some more with what's possible with *creative coding,* take some time to browse through [creative applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net/) and look at the projects.
3. *(recommended)* watch [Eyeo 2014 - Frieder Nake](https://vimeo.com/104315361)
